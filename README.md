1. Write a program to perform the following using Playfair cipher technique
  i) Encrypt a given message M with different keys {k1, k2,â€¦,kn}.  Print key and cipher text pair    
  ii)Decrypt the cipher texts obtained in (i) to get back M.

2. Write a program to perform the following using Hill cipher:
  i)	Encrypt a message M with a given key matrix of size 2X2 and 3X3
  ii)	Decrypt the cipher text obtained in (i) by computing inverse of the respective key matrix.

3.Perform encryption using mono-alphabetic cipher. The program should support the following:
  i) Construct an input file named plaintext.txt (consisting of 1000 alphabets, without any space or special characters)
  ii)	Encrypt the characters of plaintext.txt using any one key from (ii) and store the corresponding ciphertext characters in ciphertext.txt
  iii)	Compute the frequency of occurrence of each alphabet in both plaintext.txt and ciphertext.txt and tabulate the results as follows
  Frequency	Plaintext character	Ciphertext character
  12.34     A                    X

4. Write a program to perform encryption and decryption using transposition technique with column permutation given as key.

5. Generate and print 48-bit keys for all sixteen rounds of DES algorithm, given a 64-bit initial key.

6. i)	Given 64-bit output of (i-1)th round of DES, 48-bit ith round key Ki and E table, find the 48-bit input for S-box.
  ii)	Given 48-bit input to S-box and permutation table P, find the 32-bit output Ri of ith round of DES algorithm.

7. Consider the 128 bits initial key and expand it to 10 different keys each of size 128 bits using AES key expansion technique.
