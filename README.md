Cryptography and Network Security Lab (7th sem)

1. Write a program to perform the following using Playfair cipher technique
  i) Encrypt a given message M with different keys {k1, k2,â€¦,kn}.  Print key and cipher text pair    
  ii)Decrypt the cipher texts obtained in (i) to get back M.

2. Write a program to perform the following using Hill cipher:
  i)	Encrypt a message M with a given key matrix of size 2X2 and 3X3
  ii)	Decrypt the cipher text obtained in (i) by computing inverse of the respective key matrix

4. Write a program to perform encryption and decryption using transposition technique with column permutation given as key.

5. Generate and print 48-bit keys for all sixteen rounds of DES algorithm, given a 64-bit initial key.

6. i)	Given 64-bit output of (i-1)th round of DES, 48-bit ith round key Ki and E table, find the 48-bit input for S-box.
  ii)	Given 48-bit input to S-box and permutation table P, find the 32-bit output Ri of ith round of DES algorithm.
